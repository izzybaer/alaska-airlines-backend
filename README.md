### app features

- user is able to search for flights between two locations (airport codes)
- user is able to see a list of flights matching the search params
- user is able to sort flights by departure or price(first class and main cabin)

### models

- flightSchema
    - To
    - From
    - Departs
    - Arrives
    - FlightNumber
    - DepartsMilitary

- locationSchema
    - Name
    - Code

### routes

#### POST /api/flights

- this route makes a POST request which invokes csv.Get(), a function that uses get-csv to retrieve data from the provided csv files, and populates mongodb with flights

#### GET /api/flights

- this route uses mongoose's `.find()` to retrieve all flights from the database

#### GET /api/flights/search

- this route uses mongoose's `.find().where().exec()` to perform a deep query for the `From` and `To` properties(of the flightSchema) provided by the user
    - this route fetches flights that have matching `To` and `From` queries
    
### tests

- all tests are run through jests testing suite on the backend
- jest was used to test POST and GET routes

### how to use

- fork and clone both frontend and backend repos into a directory
    - https://github.com/izzybaer/alaska-airlines-frontend
    - https://github.com/izzybaer/alaska-airlines-backend 

- open a terminal tab for the frontend, and one for the backend
- run `yarn install` in both the backend tab and the frontend tab
- once yarn has finished installing..
    - run the command `touch .env` in both terminal tabs from the root of the each repo
- open two editors, one for each repo, and in each editor window navigate to the .env file
- paste these environment variables inside the backend .env and save the file
``` 
PORT=3000
DEBUG=true
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080
APP_SECRET='change_this'
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/aa-dev
```
- paste these environment variables inside the frontend .env and save the file
```
CDN_URL=/
NODE_ENV=dev
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
- navigate back to your terminal
- open two more terminal tabs inside the backend repo
    - run `yarn dbon` in one tab - wait a couple seconds for mongodb to connect
    - run `yarn start` in another tab - wait a couple seconds for the server to start
- in the frontend terminal tab 
    - run `yarn watch` and wait for webpack to compile successfully
- in **Chrome** (ruler of all browsers)
    - navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### contributions
    
- wanna contribute?
    - maybe you have a great idea for refactoring
    - maybe you have more optimal solutions for fetching data and virtual DOM rendering
    - make a PR! 
        


### now you can get started searching for flights!
